# Wave Function Collapse

This is an extension of [The Coding Trains Wave Function Collapse](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/171-wave-function-collapse)

Wave Function Collapse is a method to match different tiles together, so the borders are seamless and fit to each other.

The original code has been extended with several things, different tile sets, selectable tiles, adjustable size, start seed and a link to send the current configuration to a friend.
